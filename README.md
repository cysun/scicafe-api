# Science Campus Activities for Fostering Engagement (SciCAFE)

SciCAFE is a web portal for students and faculty to manage and advertise
STEM events at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA). It also
includes a reward system that encourages the participation of these events.

Sci-CAFE is part of the [Inclusive Exellence](http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/inclusiveexcellence)
program that aims to lower and eventually eliminate the achievement gap among students
from different backgrounds. The program is funded by the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute (HHMI) and led by Dr. Andre Ellis at CSULA. SciCAFE was implemented by
Yi Chen as his [MS thesis project](https://csns.calstatela.edu/download?fileId=7491908) under
the supervision of Dr. Chengyu Sun.
